This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing patterns, retention behavior, returns, and regional performance using a complete analytics pipeline.

I used Python for cleaning, SQL for advanced analysis, and Power BI for visualization to turn raw customer data into clear business insights and actionable solutions.
<br>

### 🚀 Project Workflow
<br>

🔹 1. Data Cleaning – Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Removed duplicates & missing values

Standardized data formats

Cleaned categorical inconsistencies

Generated a refined dataset ready for SQL analysis

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

<br>

🔹 2. Data Analysis – SQL (Advanced Queries)

Performed deep customer & sales analysis using:

Joins

Grouping & aggregation

Window functions

Customer segmentation

RFM-style behavior breakdown

Region & category performance analysis

This helped uncover revenue, retention, and demand patterns.

<br>

🔹 3. Dashboard Visualization – Power BI

All insights were converted into an interactive dashboard showing:

Customer retention

Age group analysis

Regional performance

Category-wise returns

Sales trends

Key KPIs

The dashboard helps decision-makers explore the data with filters and dynamic charts.

<br>

## 🔍 Key Insights
<br>

1️⃣ Customer Retention is Low

Most customers made only one purchase.

Repeat customers generated more revenue, but they are few.

2️⃣ High Returns in Certain Product Categories

A few categories have large return volumes, impacting revenue.

Possible mismatch in size, quality, or product descriptions.

3️⃣ Majority of buyers are 20–35 years old

This group represents the highest sales volume.

Older age groups show less activity.

4️⃣ Regional Sales Imbalance

North & West regions perform the best.

South & East see low sales and low engagement.

5️⃣ Some marketing campaigns show low ROI

High spending was not translating into conversions.

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) higher in slow regions.

<br>

## 🛠️ Recommended Solutions
<br>

✔ Improve Customer Retention

Introduce loyalty programs, reward points, or cashback on 2nd purchase.

Personalized offers based on buying history.

Follow-up engagement emails for one-time buyers.

✔ Reduce High Return Rates

Strengthen product quality checks.

Better product descriptions & sizing guides.

Identify vendors contributing to high return counts.

✔ Target High-Value Age Group (20–35)

Focus ads on platforms used by this age group.

Influencer collaborations & targeted campaigns.

✔ Boost Underperforming Regions

Provide region-specific discounts.

Improve delivery speed & service.

Tailored advertising based on regional trends.

✔ Optimize Marketing Budget

Stop campaigns with low conversion.

Increase focus on high-ROI segments.

Use analytics dashboards to monitor monthly results.
